[Here](http://andmeteadus.github.io/2015/) you can find course material (in Estonian!) on Data Science and Visualisation, written by me and Tanel PÃ¤rnamaa.

This course ([Statistiline andmeteadus ja visualiseerimine](http://andmeteadus.github.io/2015/)) is centered around a number of interesting case studies, and it focuses on teaching good practices of data science in R by applying statistical methods on these real-life problems.
