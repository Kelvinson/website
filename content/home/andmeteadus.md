</div>

[Here](http://andmeteadus.github.io/2015/) you can find course material (in Estonian!) on Data Science and Visualisation, which we created together with Tanel PÃ¤rnamaa.
This course ["Statistiline andmeteadus ja visualiseerimine"](http://andmeteadus.github.io/2015/) is centered around a number of interesting case studies, and it focuses on teaching good practices of data science in R by applying statistical methods to solve these real-life problems.
