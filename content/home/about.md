# About me

I am a PhD student in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford,  supervised by [Christopher Yau](http://cwcyau.github.io/) and [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). 

I have a broad interest in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. My current research focuses on developing probabilistic latent variable models as well as inference techniques with applications to biomedical data. 

I am also passionate about data visualisation and R. I co-organise the [Oxford R user group](https://www.meetup.com/Oxford-R-User-Group/?_cookie-check=YjefwQo7hibpOazc) meetups.
