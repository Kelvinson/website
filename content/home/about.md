# About me

I am a PhD student in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford, as part of the [OxCSML](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) group in the Department of Statistics. I am supervised by [Christopher Yau](http://cwcyau.github.io/) and [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). 

I have a broad interest in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. My PhD research focuses on developing probabilistic latent variable models as well as inference techniques with applications to biomedical data. I am currently working on extensions of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models. 

I am also enthusiastic about R and data visualisation, and I co-organise the [Oxford R user group](https://www.meetup.com/Oxford-R-User-Group/?_cookie-check=YjefwQo7hibpOazc) meetups. Additionally, I am enthusiastic about probabilistic programming frameworks such as Stan and Edward. 

Prior to the PhD, I studied for BSc and MSc at the University of Tartu in Estonia. There I was part of the BIIT research group at the Institute of Computer Science, where I worked on statistical modelling in genomics under the supervision of [Raivo Kolde](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IYhbHFMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Leopold Parts](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/parts-leopold).
