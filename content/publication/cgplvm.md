abstract = "Dimensionality reduction is a key step towards gaining insights into complex high-dimensional data. Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) offer a principled way of performing probabilistic non-linear dimensionality reduction. However, often there is *a priori* known structure in the data in the form of covariate information or class labels. To obtain a low-dimensional representation which would capture patterns beyond what is induced by the covariates, we propose the covariate-GPLVM (c-GPLVM). This flexible model class lets us capture non-linear interactions between covariates and latent variables, while maintaining interpretability. Using various toy examples as well as disease progression modelling in cancer genomics, we demonstrate how c-GPLVM reveals meaningful latent structure which is shared across different class labels or covariate values."

However, real-life data often exhibits strong structure which is *a priori* known to us. This could be in the form of covariate information or class labels. Here, we propose the covariate-GPLVM to learn a covariate-adjusted low-dimensional representation which would reveal meaningful latent structure shared across different class labels or covariate values."
